# Pyoncord-Theme

Fully-fledged theme made for Pyoncord (themes+ support, custom fonts soon)! 
- Supports the most recent versions of discord! Also works with some older versions and the youbar (which was removed in 226.6)
- This is my first new ui theme, but thanks to the help of some amazing people it became even better! (Thank you).

> Rairof, for helping me make my theme what it is (finding a ton of keys missing in my theme and much more). <br>
> Moodle, for the current background.
